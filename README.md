# Note Taker 

## Description
This note taker application allows users to create notes and delete them. We receieved starter code that contained all of the front end code.
We had to refractor the code and connect the front end to the back end using express.js and saving and retrieving the data via a JSON file. 

## How to use
- Click on the 'Get Started' 
- From there you can create your title and notes on the right side of the page.
- After that click on the 'Save' button on the top right-hand corner to create a tab.
- To delete notes just click the trash bin on the left hand-side of each created note.
